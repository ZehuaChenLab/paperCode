Fires often bring economic losses, threaten lives, and cause environmental pollution. To reduce fire damage, we need to detect different types of fires as early as possible and upload fire alarm information in a timely manner. To this end, we propose a model based on YOLOv8: EFDC-YOLO (Efficient Fire Detect and Classify model based on YOLO). First, by designing and embedding the Dynamic Ghost Conv with SS2D (DGSS) module in the model's backbone, we achieve the capture of flame detail features and the extraction of spatial information around the fire, which allows for the classification of different types of fires. Secondly, to effectively capture features of flames at different scales, we propose the Strip Large Kernel Module (SLSM) and integrate it into the neck of the model. Finally, we have also constructed and publicly released a dataset including building fires, vehicle fires, and forest fires. In addition, we have designed a comprehensive fire alarm system that can identify different types of fires and transmit information to different managers, which will be demonstrated in the supplementary materials. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we have tested it on the public dataset M4SFWD and our self-built dataset, achieving improvements of 3.2% and 1.7% in mAP@.5 compared to YOLOv8. At the same time, our model has shown improvements when compared with other models in the YOLO series.
